My research investigates patterns in round and series (of rounds) win percentages in Call of Duty (Search and Destroy) and Valorant pro matches. I find evidence in both games violating the naive assumption that a series represents a sequence of independent events (rounds), with each team having a constant probability of winning a given round (0.5). Additionally, I quantify the impact of game-specific phenomenon---offensive aggression in the 4-4 round state in Call of Duty, and post-"pistol round" wins in Valorant---on series win percentages.
