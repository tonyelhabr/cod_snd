\begin{abstract}
My research investigates patterns in round win percentages in
professional Search and Destroy (SnD) matches of the popular
first-person shooter game Call of Duty (CoD). First, I find evidence
supprting the hypothesis that round win probability can be modeled as a
constant across the series, although not at the naive 50\%. Second, I
examine post-streak round win probability, in search of evidence
positive recency (the ``hot hand'' fallacy) or negative recency (the
``gambler's falacy''). I find that teams perform significantly worse
than expected after streaks of 2, 3, and 4 wins when series end up going
to 9, 10, or 11 (maximum) rounds, suggesting the presence of negative
recency.

\subsection{Description of Call of Duty Search and
Destroy}\label{description-of-call-of-duty-search-and-destroy}}

Call of Duty (CoD), first released in 2003, is one of the most popular
first-person shooter (FPS) video game franchises of all-time. The most
popular mode in the competitive scene is ``Search and Destroy''
(SnD).\footnote{SnD bears resemblance to ``Bomb Defusal'' in
  Counter-Strike and ``Plant/Defuse'' in Valorant, two other FPS games
  played in more popular professional leagues.} SnD is a one-sided game
mode in which one team, the offensive side, tries to destroy one of two
designated bomb sites on the map.

In professional CoD SnD, a team take turns playing offense and defense
every round. They must win six rounds to win the series.\footnote{A
  maximum of 11 even rounds can be played. There is no ``sudden death''
  or ``win by two'' rule like there are for SnD equivalent in
  professional Counter-Strike and Valorant matches.} A round can end in
one of five ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  One team eliminates all members of the other team prior to a bomb
  plant. (Eliminating team wins.)
\item
  The offensive team eliminates all members of the defensive team after
  a bomb plant.\footnote{\begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      The bomb can be picked up by any member of the offensive team.
    \item
      The bomb carrier is not obstructed at all by carrying the bomb
      (i.e.~movement is the same, weapon usage is the same).
    \item
      The defense does not get any visual indication for who is carrying
      the bomb.
    \item
      A bomb plant takes five seconds. The timer resets if the player
      stops planting site prior to completing it.
    \item
      A bomb defuse takes seven seconds. The timer resets if the player
      ``drops'' the bomb.
    \item
      The bomb takes 45 seconds to defuse after being planted.
    \end{itemize}} (Offense wins.)
\item
  The defensive team defuses the bomb after a bomb plant.\footnote{Often
    the defensive team will try to eliminate all team members prior to
    making the defuse, but in some cases, they may try to ``ninja''
    defuse.} (Defense wins.)
\item
  The offensive team does not make a plant by the time the round timer
  ends. (Defense wins.)
\end{enumerate}

I adopt the terminology ``series'' to refer to what CoD SnD players
typically call a ``match'', so as to emulate the terminology of playoff
series in professional leagues like the National Basketball Association,
National Hockey League, and Major League Baseball. A ``game'' or a
``match'' in such leagues is analogous to a ``round'' of CoD SnD.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsection{Data}\label{data}}

CoD has roughly gone through three eras of professional gaming: (1)
Major League Gaming (MLG) tournaments prior to 2016; (2) the CoD World
League (CWL), initiated in 2016; and (3) the 12-franchise CoD League
(CDL), operating since 2020. The CDL has completed three year-long
``seasons'' as of August 2022.\footnote{CoD is fairly unique compared to
  other esports in that it runs on an annual lifecycle (released coming
  in the late fall), where a new game is published every year under the
  same title. Each new game bears resemblance to past ones, often
  introducing relatively small variations (``improvements'') to
  graphics, game modes, and other facets of gameplay. During the CDL
  era, the games released have been Modern Warfare (2020), Cold War
  (2021) and Vanguard (2022).}

The data set consists of all SnD matches played in tournanaments and
qualifiers during the CDL era, totaling 7,792 rounds across 852 series.
Data was collected in spreadsheets by community member
``IOUTurtle''.\footnote{Data: \url{https://linktr.ee/CDLArchive}.
  Author: \url{https://twitter.com/IOUTurtle}}

The empirical offensive round win percentage across all rounds is
47.8\%.\footnote{Offensive round win percentage has been nearly constant
  across the three games during the CDL era: 1. 47.2\% in MW (2020) 2.
  47.9\% in Cold War (2021) 3. 48.1\% in Vanguard (2022)} Table
\ref{tbl:cod-o-win-prop-by-series-state} shows round win percentages by
series ``state'' (i.e.~the number of round wins by each team prior to an
upcoming round). Offensive round win rate is not quite constant,
although never veers more than 10\% from this global average.

\section{Literature review}\label{literature-review}}

There have been a handful of studies of the distribution of games played
in a series of a professional sport. Most assume a constant probability
\(p\) of a given team winning a game in the series, regardless of the
series state. Mosteller (1952) observed that the American League had
dominated the National League in Major League Baseball's (MLB) World
Series matchups, implying that matchups should not modeled with
\(p = 0.5\). Mosteller proposed three approaches for identifying the
optimal constant probability value of the stronger team in the World
Series, finding \(p \approx 0.65\). in each case: (1) solving for \(p\)
from the empirical average number of games won by the loser of the
series, which he called the ``method of moments'' approach; (2)
maximizing the likelihood that the sample would have been drawn from a
population in which the probability of a team winning a game is constant
across the series (i.e.~maximum likelihood), and (3) minimizing the
chi-square goodness of fit statistic for \(p\).

Chance (2020) re-examines the constant probability notion in Major
League Baseball's World Series (1923--2018), the National Basketball
Association's Finals (1951--2018), and the National Hockey League's
Stanley Cup (1939--2018). Chance finds strong evidence against the null
hypothesis of \(p = 0.5\) in the MLB and NHL championship series when
applying Mosteller's first and second methods.{[}\^{}8{]} {[}\^{}8{]}:
Chance goes on to outline a conditional probability framework
(likelihood of winning a game given the series state) which can exactly
explain the distribution of the number of games played.

Momentum, one of most discussed topics in sports analytics, goes
hand-in-hand with a discussion of the nature of series
outcomes.\footnote{We often use use ``streaks'' and momentum
  interchangeably, but as (Steeger, Dulin, and Gonzalez 2021) note,
  momentum implies dependence between events, whereas streaking does
  not.} Two opposing fallacies are observed in the context of momentum:
the ``gambler's fallacy'' (negative recency) and ``hot hand fallacy''
(positive recency). Per Ayton et al. (2004), negative recency is ``the
belief that, for random events, runs of a particular outcome \ldots{}
will be balanced by a tendency for the opposite outcome'', while
positive recency is the expectation of observing future results that
match recent results.

Studying both player streaks and team streaks in basketball, in both
observational and controlled settings. Gilovich et al. (1985) do not
find evidence for the hot hand phenomenon. However, Miller and Sanjurjo
(2018) refuted the conclusions of Gilovich et al., proving a framework
for quantifying streak selection bias, which effectively works in the
manner posited by the gambler's fallacy\footnote{Streak selection bias,
  ``in conjunction with a quasi-Bayesian model of decision making under
  sample size neglect\ldots{} provides a novel structural candidate
  explanationfor the persistence of gambler's fallacy beliefs'', per
  Miller and Sanjurjo (2018).}. Specifically, Miller and Sanjurjo say
that a ``bias exists in a common measure of the conditional dependence
of present outcomes on streaks of past outcomes in sequential data''
implying that, under i.i.d. conditions, ``the proportion of successes
among the outcomes that immediately follow a streak of consecutive
successes is expected to be strictly less than the underlying
(conditional) probability of success''. When applying streak selection
bias to Giloveih et al.'s data, Miller and Sanjurjo come to the opposite
conclusions as Giloveih et al.

Despite the plethora of existing research on games played in a series
and momentum in sports, these topics have yet to be investigated heavily
in esports. Work has been done to examine in-round win probability in
other FPS titles such as Counter-Strike (Xenopoulos, Freeman, and Silva
2022) and Valorant (DeRover 2021), both of which are round-based like
CoD SnD. However, research on round-level trends is sparse, perhaps
because games like Counter-Strike and Valorant both have economic
aspects that can create clear advantages on side in a given round, given
how prior rounds played out.\footnote{Additionally, both Counter-Strike
  and Valorant have overtime rules and blocked offensive/defensive roles
  (i.e.~playing either offense or defense for many consecutive rounds).}

\section{Methodology}\label{methodology}}

\hypertarget{sec:method-rounds-played}{%
\subsection{Distribution of rounds
played}\label{sec:method-rounds-played}}

The general formula for the probability \(P_E(r)\) that a best-of-\(s\)
series (\(s = 11\) for CoD SnD) lasts \(r\) rounds given constant
probability \(p\) of one team\footnote{If \(p > 0.5\), then one might
  say that this team is the better team (known in hindsight).} winning
each round is

\[
m = \frac{s + 1}{2}
\]

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:series-length}{}{
P_E(r) = \frac{(r - 1)!}{(m - 1)!(r - s)!}(p^{m}(1 - p)^{r - m} + p^{r - m}(1 - p)^m).
}\label{eq:series-length}\end{equation}

The chi-square goodness of fit statistic can be used to test the
constant found probability hypothesis for \(0 \leq p \leq 1\).

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:chi-squ}{}{
\chi^2 = \sum^R \frac{(P_O(r) - P_E(r))^2}{P_E(r)}
}\label{eq:chi-squ}\end{equation}

For CoD SnD, \(r \in R [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]\).

\hypertarget{sec:method-momentum}{%
\subsection{Momentum}\label{sec:method-momentum}}

Without accounting for the streak selection bias described by Miller and
Sanjurjo (2018), the round win probability after a streak of \(k\) round
wins for a best-of-\(s\) series (\(s = 11\) for CoD SnD), accounting for
the series lasting \(r\) rounds known in hindsight, is

\[
m = \frac{s + 1}{2}
\]

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:pwkr}{}{
  p^{w|kr} = p(\text{win | k, r})=\{
    \begin{array}{cl}
    \frac{m - k}{i - k}, & \text{team wins series} \\
    \frac{s - m - k}{i - k}, & \text{team loses series}
    \end{array}.
  }
\label{eq:pwkr}
\end{equation}

The ``hindsight'' round loss probability after a streak of \(k\) round
losses for a series lasting \(r\) rounds, \(p^{l|kr}\), can be
formulated symmetrically.\footnote{Note that these probabilities are
  separate from the constant round probabilities in Sections
  \ref{sec:method-rounds-played} and \ref{sec:results-rounds-played}.}

However, as shown by Miller and Sanjurjo, we should expect the observed
proportion of rounds wins after a streak \(k\) rounds wins for a series
lasting \(r\) rounds, \(\hat{P}_{w|kr}\), to be strictly less than
\(p^{w|kr}\).

\begin{quote}
Theorem 1: \emph{Let}
\(\mathbf{X} = \{X_i\}^{n}_{i=1}, n \geq 3\)\emph{, be a sequence of
independent Bernoulli trials, each with probability of success}
\(0 < p < 1\)\emph{. Let} \(\hat{P}_k(\mathbf{X})\) \emph{be the
proportion of successes on the subset of trials} \(I_k(\mathbf{X})\)
\emph{that immediately follow} \(k\) consecutive successes, that is,
\(\hat{P}_k(\mathbf{X}) := \sum_{i \in I_k(\mathbf{X})} X_i | I_k(\mathbf{X}) |. \hat{P}_k\)
\emph{is a biased estimate of}
\(\mathbb{P}(X_t = 1 | \prod_{j=t-k}^{t-1} X_j = 1) \equiv p\) \emph{for
all} \(k\) \emph{such that} \(1 \leq k \leq n - 2\)\emph{. In
particular,}
\(E[\hat{P}_k(\mathbf{X}) | I_k(\mathbf{X}) \neq \emptyset] < p.\)
\end{quote}

Miller and Sanjurjo (2018) note that there does not exists a closed form
representation for
\(E[\hat{P}_k(\mathbf{X}) | I_k(\mathbf{X}) \neq \emptyset]\) for
\(k > 1\).

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

First, I investigate the constant probability assumption and the
distribution of rounds played in a series. Chance's (2020) work is
closely related to mine, and, in fact, provides a guide for this
investigation.

\hypertarget{sec:results-rounds-played}{%
\subsection{Distribution of rounds
played}\label{sec:results-rounds-played}}

Using Equation \ref{eq:chi-squ}, \(\chi^2 = 16.0\) (p-value of 0.0068)
for a naive constant round win probability \(p_0 = 0.5\). Thus, I can
comfortably reject the constant probability null hypothesis for
\(p_0 = 0.5\), even at a confidence level of \(\alpha = 0.01\).
Afterwards, I investigate post-streak win rates, building on my
learnings from the constant probability assumption analysis. I agree
with Miller and Sanjurjo's (2018) framework for streak selection bias,
accounting for it in when analyzing momentum.

Table \ref{tbl:cod-prob-series-lasting-r-rounds} shows the expected
probabilities for \(s = 11\) under the naive assumption that
\(p_0 = 0.5\) for a given round, along with the observed proportions
\(P_O(r)\) in CoD SnD.

\begin{longtable}{rrrr}
\caption{The probabilities that a best-of-11 series lasts $r$ rounds ($P_E(r)$, where $r \in [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]$) under the assumption that each team has a 50\% probability ($p_0 = 0.5$) of winning each game. The observed frequencies observed are shown as a count $N_O(r)$ and as a proportion $P_O(r)$ of all series.}\label{tbl:cod-prob-series-lasting-r-rounds} \\

11 & $24.6\%$ & $23.7\%$ & 202 \\ 
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Table \ref{tbl:mosteller-methods-results} shows the alternate values for
the constant round win probability \(p\) that I find when applying the
three methods suggested by Mosteller (1952). Each is approximately or
equal to 0.575, and, when applying Equation \ref{eq:chi-squ}, each
results in a \(\chi^2\) value for which I cannot reject the constant
probability null hypothesis.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lrr@{}}
\caption{Alternate estimates of the constant probability \(p\) for winning a given round in a CoD SnD, applying the three methods suggested by Mosteller (1952), in addition to the naive \(p = 0.5\).}\label{tbl:mosteller-methods-results} \\

3. Minimum \(\chi^2\) & 0.5775 & 3.5 (0.62) \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

Table \ref{tbl:expected-series-lengths-alternative-ps} shows the new
\(P_E(r)\) when re-applying Equation \ref{eq:series-length} for the
maximum likelihood estimate \(p_2 = 0.575\).\footnote{The method of
  moments and minimum \(\chi^2\) estimates for \(p\) are omitted simply
  because the results would be nearly identical to those for the maximum
  likelihood estimate of \(p\) (since they are all \(\approx 0.575\)).}
I observe that \(P_E(r)\) is notably larger for \(p_{2}\) when
\(r \in [6, 7]\), more closely matching \(P_O(r)\). \(p_{2}\) is also
closer to \(P_O(r)\) for \(r \in [9, 10]\), although not for
\(r \in [8, 11]\).

\end{longtable}

It is fair to conclude that the constant round win probability
assumption can be valid in CoD SnD series with the appropriate choice of
\(p\) (\(\approx 0.575\)).

\subsection{Momentum}\label{sec:results-momentum}}

Given that people typically perceive streaks as beginning after the
third success (or failure) at minimum (Carlson and Shu 2007), I focus on
round win percentages in rounds immediately following streaks of three
wins.\footnote{Three happens to also be a reasonable number for series
  that lasts at maximum 11 rounds.} Table

\(\hat{P}^{kr,\text{win}}_O\) and \(\hat{P}^{kr,\text{loss}}_O\) for
