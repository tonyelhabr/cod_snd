\begin{abstract}
My research investigates patterns in round win percentages in
professional Search and Destroy (SnD) matches of the popular
first-person shooter game Call of Duty (CoD). First, I find evidence
supprting the hypothesis that round win probability can be modeled as a
constant across the series, although not at the naive 50\%. Second, I
examine post-streak round win probability, given the series outcome. I
find no evidence that post-streak win rate is significantly different
than expected for combinations of streak length, series length, and
series winner, suggesting that the perception of momentum at the team
level is just that, perception.

\hypertarget{game-description}{%
\subsection{Game Description}\label{game-description}}

Call of Duty (CoD), first released in 2003, is one of the most popular
first-person shooter (FPS) video game franchises of all-time. The most
popular mode in the competitive scene is ``Search and Destroy''
(SnD).\footnote{SnD bears resemblance to ``Bomb Defusal'' in
  Counter-Strike and ``Plant/Defuse'' in Valorant, two other FPS games
  played in more popular professional leagues.} SnD is a one-sided game
mode in which one team, the offensive side, tries to destroy one of two
designated bomb sites on the map.

In professional CoD SnD, a team take turns playing offense and defense
every round. They must win six rounds to win the series.\footnote{A
  maximum of 11 even rounds can be played. There is no ``sudden death''
  or ``win by two'' rule like there are for SnD equivalent in
  professional Counter-Strike and Valorant matches.} A round can end in
one of five ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  One team eliminates all members of the other team prior to a bomb
  plant. (Eliminating team wins.)
\item
  The offensive team eliminates all members of the defensive team after
  a bomb plant.\footnote{\begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      The bomb can be picked up by any member of the offensive team.
    \item
      The bomb carrier is not obstructed at all by carrying the bomb
      (i.e.~movement is the same, weapon usage is the same).
    \item
      The defense does not get any visual indication for who is carrying
      the bomb.
    \item
      A bomb plant takes five seconds. The timer resets if the player
      stops planting site prior to completing it.
    \item
      A bomb defuse takes seven seconds. The timer resets if the player
      ``drops'' the bomb.
    \item
      The bomb takes 45 seconds to defuse after being planted.
    \end{itemize}} (Offense wins.)
\item
  The defensive team defuses the bomb after a bomb plant.\footnote{Often
    the defensive team will try to eliminate all team members prior to
    making the defuse, but in some cases, they may try to ``ninja''
    defuse.} (Defense wins.)
\item
  The offensive team does not make a plant by the time the round timer
  ends. (Defense wins.)
\end{enumerate}

I adopt the terminology ``series'' to refer to what CoD SnD players
typically call a ``match'', so as to emulate the terminology of playoff
series in professional leagues like the National Basketball Association,
National Hockey League, and Major League Baseball. A ``game'' or a
``match'' in such leagues is analogous to a ``round'' of CoD SnD.
Further, it is analogous to a trial in statistical analysis of Bernoulli
events.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsection{Data}\label{data}}

CoD has roughly gone through three eras of professional gaming: (1)
Major League Gaming (MLG) tournaments prior to 2016; (2) the CoD World
League (CWL), initiated in 2016; and (3) the 12-franchise CoD League
(CDL), operating since 2020. The CDL has completed three year-long
``seasons'' as of August 2022.\footnote{CoD is fairly unique compared to
  other esports in that it runs on an annual lifecycle (released coming
  in the late fall), where a new game is published every year under the
  same title. Each new game bears resemblance to past ones, often
  introducing relatively small variations (``improvements'') to
  graphics, game modes, and other facets of gameplay. During the CDL
  era, the games released have been Modern Warfare (2020), Cold War
  (2021) and Vanguard (2022).}

The data set consists of all SnD matches played in major tournaments and
qualifiers during the CDL era, totaling 7,792 rounds across 852
series.\footnote{288 of the series occur in major tournaments, which are
  considered to be more ``competitive'' than the qualifiers since they
  are played in person (COVID-permitting), whereas the qualifiers are
  played online.} Data was collected in spreadsheets by community member
``IOUTurtle''.\footnote{Raw data: \url{https://linktr.ee/CDLArchive}.
  Author: \url{https://twitter.com/IOUTurtle}. Processed data can be
  found at
  \url{https://github.com/tonyelhabr/fps_round_games/blob/master/data/cod_rounds.csv}.}

The empirical offensive round win percentage across all rounds is
\(\tau_O\) = 47.8\%.\footnote{Offensive round win percentage has been
  nearly constant across the three games during the CDL era: 1. 47.2\%
  in MW (2020) 2. 47.9\% in Cold War (2021) 3. 48.1\% in Vanguard (2022)}
Table \ref{tbl:cod-o-win-prop-by-series-state} shows round win
percentages by series ``state'' (i.e.~the number of round wins by each
team prior to an upcoming round). Offensive round win rate is not quite
constant, although never veers more than 10\% from this global
average.\footnote{At tournaments, higher-seeded (``better'') teams
  choose whether they want to start on offense or defense in either the
  SnD series played as the second game or the fifth game in the
  best-of-five format used in tournaments, and their opponent is
  assigned to play offense in the first round of the SnD slot (second or
  fifth game) not chosen. ({``Competitive Settings \textbar{} Call of
  Duty League,''} n.d.) (Other game variants like Hardpoint are played
  as the first, third, and fourth games in the matchup.) Anecdotally,
  the higher-seeded teams tend to choose to play defense in the first
  round of the SnD series played as the second game, although this
  choice is not universal. With online qualifiers, teams all play each
  other twice throughout the season. Each team gets to play the
  higher-seeded role once in their matchups, despite their win-loss
  records.}

Anecdotally, observers swear by the existence of momentum in CoD SnD
series, to the extent that vernacular has been developed to describe
such phenomenon. People say that teams ``ice up'' when the team wins
several consecutive rounds to come back to win a series, often
culminating with a series-clinching round win.\footnote{This vernacular
  is not specific to CoD SnD in specific, and is not only used in the
  contexts of streaks.} Further, viewers have come to embrace the
``5-3'' phenomenon, where teams win three consecutive rounds after
facing a 5-3 deficit to win 6-5. There is even a term for the rare 0-5
comeback---a ``full sail''.

\hypertarget{literature-review}{%
\section{Literature review}\label{literature-review}}

There have been a handful of studies of the distribution of games played
in a series of a professional sport. Most assume a constant probability
\(\phi\) of a given team winning a game in the series, regardless of the
series state. Mosteller (1952) observed that the American League had
dominated the National League in Major League Baseball's (MLB) World
Series matchups, implying that games should not be modeled with a
constant (null) \(\phi_0 = 0.5\). Mosteller proposed three approaches
for identifying the optimal constant probability value of the stronger
team in the World Series, finding \(\phi \approx 0.65\) in each case:
(1) solving for \(p\) from the empirical average number of games won by
the loser of the series, which he called the ``method of moments''
approach; (2) maximizing the likelihood that the sample would have been
drawn from a population in which the probability of a team winning a
game is constant across the series (i.e.~maximum likelihood), and (3)
minimizing the chi-square goodness of fit statistic \(\chi^2\) for
\(\phi\).

Chance (2020) re-examines the constant probability notion in Major
League Baseball's (MLB) World Series (1923--2018), the National
Basketball Association's (NBA) Finals (1951--2018), and the National
Hockey League's (NHL) Stanley Cup (1939--2018). Chance finds strong
evidence against the null hypothesis of \(\phi_0 = 0.5\) in the MLB and
NHL championship series when applying Mosteller's first and second
methods. Chance goes on to outline a conditional probability framework
(likelihood of winning a game given the series state) which can exactly
explain the distribution of the number of games played.

Momentum, one of most discussed topics in sports analytics, goes
hand-in-hand with a discussion of the nature of series
outcomes.\footnote{We often use use ``streaks'' and momentum
  interchangeably, but as (Steeger, Dulin, and Gonzalez 2021) note,
  momentum implies dependence between events, whereas streaking does
  not.} Two opposing fallacies are observed in the context of momentum:
the ``gambler's fallacy'' (negative recency) and the ``hot hand
fallacy'' (positive recency). Per Ayton et al. (2004), negative recency
is ``the belief that, for random events, runs of a particular outcome
\ldots{} will be balanced by a tendency for the opposite outcome'',
while positive recency is the expectation of observing future results
that match recent results.

Studying both player streaks and team streaks in basketball, in both
observational and controlled settings. Gilovich et al. (1985),
henceforth GVT, do not find evidence for the hot hand phenomenon.
However, Miller and Sanjurjo (2018), henceforth MS, refuted the
conclusions of GVT, proving a framework for quantifying streak selection
bias, which effectively works in the manner posited by the gambler's
fallacy\footnote{Streak selection bias, ``in conjunction with a
  quasi-Bayesian model of decision making under sample size
  neglect\ldots{} provides a novel structural candidate explanation for
  the persistence of gambler's fallacy beliefs'', per MS.}.
Specifically, MS say that a ``bias exists in a common measure of the
conditional dependence of present outcomes on streaks of past outcomes
in sequential data'' implying that, under i.i.d. conditions, ``the
proportion of successes among the outcomes that immediately follow a
streak of consecutive successes is expected to be strictly less than the
underlying (conditional) probability of success''. When applying streak
selection bias to GVT.'s data, MS come to the opposite conclusions as
GVT.

Other research has borrowed a common approach from the field of quality
control, looking at unlikely sequences of events with the Wald-Wolfowitz
runs test (Peel and Clauset 2015), (Steeger, Dulin, and Gonzalez 2021).
Peel and Clauset find no evidence for unlikely sequences of scoring
events in the NHL, College Football (CFB), and National Football League
(NFL), but do in the NBA. As a check on their entropy approach to
momentum identification, Steeger et al.~found three NHL teams who
sequence of wins in the 2018-2019 regular season violated the
Wald-Wolfowitz null hypothesis, although these teams did not match the
teams identified with their primary approach.

\hypertarget{my-contribution}{%
\subsection{My contribution}\label{my-contribution}}

Despite the plethora of existing research on games played in a series
and momentum in sports, these topics have yet to be investigated
heavily, if at all, in esports. Work has been done to examine
intra-round win probability in other FPS titles such as Counter-Strike
(Xenopoulos, Freeman, and Silva 2022) and Valorant (DeRover 2021), both
of which are round-based like CoD SnD. However, considering
Counter-Strike and Valorant specifically, research on round-level trends
seems non-existant, perhaps for one of many reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Both have economic aspects that can create clear advantages for one
  side in a given round, given how prior rounds played out. CoD has no
  such equivalent, except for perhaps ``kill streaks'', which
  infrequently play a role.
\item
  Teams play either offense or defense for many consecutive rounds. (The
  former has a 14-14-1 format and the latter uses a 12-12-1 format.) On
  the other hand, teams in CoD SnD rotate roles every round, analogous
  to a 1-1-1-1-1-1-1 format for home advantage in best-of-seven series
  for professional sports like the MLB, NBA, and NHL.\footnote{1-1-1-1-1-1-1
    is not used today in these leagues, but it was at least one in each
    league.} While theoretically one might be able to account for any
  kind of format, such as a 5-5-1, the rotation of team sides every
  round is convenient for convincing ourselves that rounds could
  reasonably be modeled as i.i.d. Bernoulli trials.
\item
  Both Counter-Strike and Valorant have overtime rules---team must win
  by two rounds---which can make end-of-series sequences difficult to
  model. CoD SnD does not have overtime rules.
\end{enumerate}

To my knowledge, there is no existing public statistical research on CoD
SnD format, beyond descriptive analysis on social media. While
intra-round trends may be more directly applicable to teams looking for
an advantage on their competition, broader investigation on a common
concept like the hot-hand phenomenon in a new field---particularly one
that is less subjected to factors that may be difficult to control for,
e.g.~weather---should hopefully be useful as a precedent or supplement
for future researchers.

\section{Methodology}\label{methodology}}

\hypertarget{distribution-of-rounds-played}{%
\subsection{Distribution of rounds
played}\label{distribution-of-rounds-played}}

The formula for the expected proportion of series a best-of-\(s\) format
ending in \(r\) rounds (\(r \leq s\)), \(\hat{\Phi}(r)\), for a constant
round win probability \(\phi\) (\(0 \leq \phi \leq 1\)) for one
team\footnote{If \(\phi > 0.5\), then one might say that this team is
  the better team (known in hindsight).} is

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:m}{}{
m = \frac{s + 1}{2}
}\label{eq:m}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:series-length}{}{
\hat{\Phi}(r) = \frac{(r - 1)!}{(m - 1)!(s - r)!}(\phi^{m}(1 - \phi)^{r - m} + \phi^{r - m}(1 - \phi)^m)
}\label{eq:series-length}\end{equation}

\(s = 11\) rounds for CoD SnD.\footnote{\(\phi\) and other symbols are
  selected so as to reserve symbols like \(p\) for usage in other
  contexts without causing confusion for the reader. Upper-case symbol,
  e.g.~\(\Phi\), are consistently used in this paper to represent
  proportions, while lower-case symbols corresponding to proportions
  represent probabilities. ``Hats'', e.g.~\(\hat{\Phi}\), are used to
  convey expectations, while ``bare'' symbols mirroring hat-ed symbols
  convey observational data.}

To evaluate the constant round win probability null hypothesis---that
is, that the expected and observed round win rates, \(\hat{\Phi}(r)\)
and \(\Phi(r)\) respectively, are equal to one another---we can compute
the chi-square goodness of fit statistic, \(\chi^2\),

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:chi-squ}{}{
\chi^2 = \sum^R \frac{(\Phi(r) - \hat{\Phi}(r))^2}{\hat{\Phi}(r)}.
}\label{eq:chi-squ}\end{equation}

\(r \in R = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]\) for CoD SnD.

\hypertarget{momentum}{%
\subsection{Momentum}\label{momentum}}

\hypertarget{ms-post-streak-probability}{%
\subsubsection{MS post-streak
probability}\label{ms-post-streak-probability}}

Let us now consider round win rate immediately following a streak of
\(k\) wins, given that the series lasts \(r\) rounds. Removing our
knowledge of a streak, we might model the Bernoulli round win
probability as

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:pwr}{}{
p_0(\text{win} | r) = p^{+|r}_0 = \{
\begin{array}{cl}
\frac{m}{r}, & \text{team wins series} \\
\frac{r - m}{r}, & \text{team loses series}
\end{array}
}
\label{eq:pwr}
\end{equation}

using \(m\) from Equation \ref{eq:m}.

As shown by MS with their Theorem 1, we should expect the proportion of
rounds wins immediately following a streak of \(k\) rounds wins for a
series lasting \(r\) rounds, \(\hat{P}^{+|kr}_{MS}\), to be strictly
less than \(p^{+|r}\).\footnote{See Appendix E.1 of MS for the proof.}
Unfortunately, there does not exist a closed form representation for the
expected value of \(\hat{P}^{+|kr}_{MS}\) for \(k > 1\). Nonetheless,
one may recursively build a collection of dictionaries to compute the
expectation analytically, or, more conveniently, one may run simulations
to estimate the expected value, as I choose to do.\footnote{I have
  adapted the code from Vafa (2017), which implements MS's framework
  (2018).}

Although it would be convenient to emulate the hypothesis testing for
difference of proportions performed by MS (and GVT), my context is
fundamentally different from that of MS, who focus on longitudinal data
in controlled settings.\footnote{GVT also performs statistical tests on
  shots from players in live games, i.e.~``observational'' data, but
  they note that their findings are likely affected player shot
  selection in the face of defensive strategy by the opposing team.} The
number of trials is fixed in their experimental designs, but in CoD SnD,
the number of rounds played is determined as a function of the max
number of possible rounds (\(s\)) and whether or not the team wins the
series. The Bernoulli trial success probability, i.e.~a round win in CoD
SnD, is not independent of the opponent. Consequently, a statistical
test of the difference in \(\hat{P}^{+|kr}\) and \(\hat{P}^{-|kr}\), as
performed by MS to evaluate their hypothesis regarding post-streak
success rates, is not completely appropriate, although useful as a
reference.

\hypertarget{notional-post-streak-probability}{%
\subsubsection{``Notional'' post-streak
probability}\label{notional-post-streak-probability}}

One might consider another form of the expected proportion of rounds won
immediately after a streak of \(k\) round wins in a best-of-\(s\) series
given the length of the series (\(r\) rounds), the ``notional''
proportion \(\hat{P}^{+|kr}_0\). The Bernoulli round win probability
underlying \(\hat{P}^{+|kr}_0\) is

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:pwkr}{}{
p_0(\text{win} | k, r) = p^{+|kr}_0 =\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\frac{m - k}{r - k}, & \text{team wins series} \\
\frac{s - m - k}{r - k}, & \text{team loses series}
\end{array}
}
\label{eq:pwkr}
\end{equation}

using \(m\) from Equation \ref{eq:m}.

We can perform a binomial test to evaluate the null hypothesis
\(\omega = \omega_0\) for the observed probability of success \(\omega\)
and a user-specified \(\omega_0\), where
\(0 \leq \omega_0 \leq 1\).\footnote{\(\omega\) and other symbols are
  chosen so as to not conflict with symbols already used elsewhere for
  in other equations, either generic or for CoD SnD specifically.} If
there are \(r^+\) observed successes in a sample of \(r\) trials and we
expect that there should be \(r * \omega_0\), the probability of
arriving at this expected number of successes is

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:binom}{}{
\Pr(r^w) = {\binom {r}{r^+}} \omega^{r^+}(1-\omega)^{r-r^+}.
}\label{eq:binom}\end{equation}

Plugging in the notional proportion \(\hat{p}^{+|kr}_0\) for the null
\(\omega_0\) and the observed proportion \(P^{+|kr}\) for \(\omega\)
(treating proportions as probabilities), we can evaluate the null
hypothesis that the observed probability is equal to the notional
probability. If we can reject this null hypothesis, then we might
consider team momentum, represented by post-streak success, plausible.

One can perform the same binomial test for the MS's
streak-selection-adjusted proportion, \(\hat{P}^{+|kr}_{MS}\). FOOTY:
Given the caveats mentioned before, the results should be heeded with
caution.

We can further decompose Equation \ref{eq:pwkr} by the round \(i\)
(\(i \leq r\)) in which the streak of length \(k\) carries into.

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:pwkri}{}{
p_0(\text{win} | k, r, i) = p^{+|kri}_0 =\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\frac{m - k}{r - k}, & \text{team wins series}, i \neq r \\
1, & \text{team wins series}, i = r \\
\frac{s - m - k}{r - k}, & \text{team loses series}, i \neq r \\
0, & \text{team loses series}, i = r
\end{array}
}
\label{eq:pwkri}
\end{equation}

Again, one might apply a binomial test to evaluate the hypothesis that
the expected proportions, both \(\hat{P}^{+|kri}_0\) and
\(\hat{P}^{+|kri}_{MS}\), are equal to the observed proportion
\(P^{+|kr}\).

\hypertarget{wald-wolfowitz-runs-test}{%
\subsubsection{Wald-Wolfowitz runs
test}\label{wald-wolfowitz-runs-test}}

Stepping back from the one-sided perspective of a single team's round
win probability when streaking, one can attempt to detect the hot hand
phenomenon with the Wald-Wolfowitz runs test. Under the null hypothesis,
the number of runs in a sequence of \(r\) trials, \(\zeta(r)\), is a
random variable that can take on values \(r^+\) and \(r^-\) for success
and failure respectively, with the following mean \(\mu\) and variance
\(\sigma^2\).

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:ww}{}{
\mu = \frac{2r^{+}r^{-}}{r} + 1, \sigma^2 = \frac{(\mu-1)(\mu-2)}{r-1}
}\label{eq:ww}\end{equation}

To incorporate my findings regarding constant round win probability, I
can specify that \(\Pr(r^+) = \phi\) (and, conversely, that
\(\Pr(r^-) = 1 - \phi\)).

One can subset the observed series sequences to those that violate the
run test null hypothesis and perform a test of proportions, where the
null is that the observed rate \(\psi^+\) of such series is equal to the
frequency rate \(\psi_0\). The test statistic \(Z\)

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:prop}{}{
Z = \frac{\psi^+ - \psi^+_0}{\sqrt{\psi^+_d (1 - \psi^+_d) ( \frac{1}{N^+} + \frac{1}{\hat{N}^+})}}
}\label{eq:prop}\end{equation}

where \(\psi^+_d = \frac{r^+ - \hat{r}^+}{N^+ - \hat{N}^+}\). If we can
reject the null hypothesis for many sequences, then there is implicit
evidence in favor of the hot hand.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

First, I investigate the constant probability assumption and the
distribution of rounds played in a series. Chance's (2020) work is
closely related to mine, and, in fact, provides a guide for this
investigation. Afterwards, I investigate post-streak win rates and the
context of momentum.

\hypertarget{distribution-of-rounds-played-1}{%
\subsection{Distribution of rounds
played}\label{distribution-of-rounds-played-1}}

Using Equation \ref{eq:chi-squ}, I find that \(\chi^2 = 16.0\)
(\(p\)-value of 0.0068) for the naive constant round win probability
\(\phi_0 = 0.5\). Thus, I can comfortably reject the constant
probability hypothesis for the null \(\phi_0 = 0.5\), even at a
confidence level of \(\alpha = 0.01\).

Table \ref{tbl:mosteller-methods-results} shows the alternate values for
the constant round win probability that I find when applying the three
methods suggested by Mosteller (1952). Each is approximately or equal to
0.575, and, when applying Equation \ref{eq:chi-squ}, each results in a
\(\chi^2\) value for which I cannot reject the constant probability null
hypothesis.

Observing that \(\hat{\Phi}_2(r)\) reasonably matches \(\Phi(r)\)
(especially in comparison to \(\hat{\Phi}_0(r)\)), along with the null

it is fair to conclude that the constant round win probability
assumption can be valid in CoD SnD series with the appropriate choice of
\(\phi\) (\(\approx 0.575\)).

\subsection{Momentum}\label{momentum-1}}

Given that people typically perceive streaks as beginning after the
third success (or failure) at minimum (Carlson and Shu 2007), I focus on
streaks of three round wins.\footnote{Three happens to also be a
  reasonable number for series that lasts at maximum 11 rounds.} Table
\ref{tbl:cod-pw3r-pl3r} compares the observed round win rate
\(P^{w,kr}\) following streaks of \(k=3\) round wins given the series
outcome (\(r\) rounds and winner) with the notional and MS expected
proportions, \(\hat{P}^{+|kr}_0\) and \(\hat{P}^{+|kr}_{MS}\)
respectively.

\begin{longtable}{rcrrrrr}
\caption{Given the round win streak $k$, the length of the series ($r$ rounds), and the series winner, the observed count of rounds wins, $r^{+|kr}$, and proportion of round wins, $P^{+|kr}$, among $N^{kr}$ instances where a team could win after the streak $k=3$ ($P^{+|kr} = \frac{r^{+|kr}}{N^{kr}}$). Additionally, the notional and MS expected proportions, $\hat{P}^{+|kr}_0$ and $\hat{P}^{+|kr}_{MS}$ respectively.}

With the exception of \(\hat{P}^{+|kr}_{MS}\) when \(r = 10\) and the
eventual series loser is the team that wins after a streak of three
round wins\footnote{This implies that the opponent, the eventual series
  winner, goes on to win the series 6-4 after going down 0-4. This is
  the only scenario in which one team wins four rounds consecutively but
  loses a best-of-11 series in 10 rounds.}, all un-adjusted binomial
test \(p\)-values are greater than the typical \(\alpha = 0.05\)
threshold, implying that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the
expected notional and MS post-streak round win rates are different than
the observed proportion. Adjusting the \(p\)-values with the Benjamini
\& Yekutieli (BY) correction (2001), the null hypothesis cannot be
rejected for any case.\footnote{As noted before, the MS expectations may
  be unreliable for CoD SnD, so one is inclined to prefer the results of
  the notional binomial tests.}

When performing the same tests for streaks of two, four, and five, there
is no case in which I can reject the binomial null hypothesis for the
expected notional probability \(p^{+|kr}_0\). The null hypothesis can
only be rejected for the expected MS probability \(p^{+|kr}_{MS}\) when
\(k = 5, r = 7\) after applying the BY p-value correction.\footnote{At
  36, the sample size for \$k = 5, r = 7\$ is not as large as most other
  combinations of \$k\$ and \$r\$.}

Now let us explicitly consider the round, \(i\). As shown in Table
\ref{tbl:cod-pw3ri-pl3ri}, the notional win rate in the round \(i\)
immediately following a streak of \(k\) round wins in a series lasting
\(r\) rounds, \(\hat{P}{+|kri}_0\), is statistically different than the
observed \(P^{+|kri}\) in several cases, notably when \(r = i\) for each
of \(r \in [9, 10, 11]\).\footnote{The null can also be rejected for
  \(r \in [7, 8]\), although these are not shown, and the sample sizes
  are smaller.} Interestingly, the observed rate is greater than the
expected rate in each case where we can reject the null hypothesis,
whereas the observed rate is less than the expected rate in all other
cases, as well in a strong majority of cases not shown.

In Table \ref{tbl:cod-runs}, the observed and expected count of
sequences, \(N^{\zeta r}\) and \(\hat{N}^{\zeta r}\) respectively, are
shown for sequences, \(\zeta(r)\), for which one can reject the
Wald-Wolfowitz null hypothesis at a confidence level of
\(\alpha = 0.05\), for \(r \in [8, 9, 10]\). (In addition to these 13,
there are 12 additional sequences for \(r = 11\).) The relative
frequency of the expected proportions are based on 10,000 simulations
using the constant round probability \(\phi_2 = 0.575\). A test for
difference between the actual and expected proportions of all sequences
indicates that the null hypothesis---that the two proportions are
equal---cannot be rejected for any of the 25 significant sequences.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

For the sake of brevity, I did not delve into win rates and streaks
split by offensive or defensive role. For example, it would be
interesting to look at whether the round win rate is higher after a
streaks of three round wins when the team starts the streak winning as
the offensive team. This would mean that, in the round immediately
following the streak, the streaking team would be playing defense, where
teams are slightly more likely to win on average. On the other hand,
streaks of three starting with an offensive round win---theoretically,
given \(\tau_O\) = 47.7\% the expected frequency is
\(\tau_O^2 \times (1 - \tau_O) \approx\) 11.9\%---are likely to occur
less frequently than such streaks starting with a defensive
win---\(\tau_O \times (1 - \tau_O)^2 \approx\) 13.0\%---so I would want
to account for sample size differences.

Further regarding future work, I've reached out to the Twitter user
``R11stats'', who privately tracks in-round player
engagements.\footnote{\url{https://twitter.com/R11stats}} R11stats
expressed intent on making the data public, which would allow for
research into player-specific momentum.
